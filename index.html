    <h4>CHRISTMAS PRESENTS</h4>
    <h5>12/22/2018</h5>
    <p>Christmas is just around the corner and I'm so stressing about buying presents.  I hate this time of the year.  I feel like I need a new strategy when it comes to buying presents for people.  I need to buy presents sporadically throughout the year. This is so I can be less stressful about getting presents for people when the time comes around.   </p>
    <p>I think one of the best last minute gifts are of course: Money and gift cards.  What do you think the best gifts is/are? </p>

    <h4>SICK, SO SICK</h4>
    <h5>12/13/2018</h5>
    <p>I can't believe that I got sick.  Yesterday when I went in for work, my throat started to hurt.  It strained my right neck muscles.  The pain then moved towards my ear.  My ear was hurting like crazy.  It seemed unreal, but I was not happy at all.  I felt helpless.  I had to finish my work.  I didn't want my co-workers to think that I was puling a stunt.  Even though I was in pain, I just had to deal with the pain.  My body is aching right now.  I just took one of my finals.  I'm here on campus until 5pm.  I just want to go home and take a hot shower.  </p>
    <p>My throat is very sore.  Sore to the point where I can barely swallow food.  Not even liquid.  I'm not sure how I got this, but damn it, it sucks. I'm debating if I want to go home.  I feel like I should.  One more final to go.  It's only 10am, my next final is at 4pm.  I wish there was a place here on campus that is warm.  It's fucking cold in the library, cafeteria, and outside.  Geez. I'm just complaining at this point.  I'm hungry, but my throat is to painful to swallow.  Fuck that. I just want this sore throat to pass already.   </p>

    <h4>FACT ONE</h4>
    <h5>12/11/2018</h5>
    <p>I decided I wanted to put some facts about me.  This is the first official fact number one.  I have test anxiety.  I was sitting here typing, thinking about finals, and it hit me!  The feeling of FEAR: "What if fail the test?""  The feeling of HELPLESSNESS!  This feeling of what could be a PANIC ATTACK!  It is very discomforting.  I'm fighting with these anxieties. I'm trying to calm it down.  One way to calm these aniexties is to motivate myself. I would think about all the successful people in my life. They would inspire me to keep going.
      I'm so close to that ticket.  The ticket that is going to get me out of the place I've called home.  I was born here.  When am I going to leave the nest? OMGGGGGGGGGG!!!   </p>
    <p>I hope I didn't lose you.  Let me take you back. My test anxiety acts up at times.  The real solution to this is, JUST STUDY.  If I study, I should be ok.  I know how the test is set up. Ugh, Test Anxiety, yup, fact one.  </p>

      <h4>Tired</h4>
      <h5>12/08/2018</h5>
      <p>(Yawn) I usually don't wake up until 10am-ish.  It's definitely a habit.  It's my normal wake up hour.  My first class starts at 11am this semester.  ...It's 9am right now.  I have two hours to kill.  I decided to come and blog out.  Wanting to escape the noises around me, I quickly turn on soundcloud.  Thank gawd for soundcloud.  I can finally listen to my favorite circuit party djs.  Listening to these tribal beats music makes me miss the good old circuit party days.  It was a part of my life that made me happy at one point.  
          I think about the circuit parties at times and wonder what it is like now.  I think about who still attends the massive sausage party. Literally. </p>
            <p>Since I'm on the subject of gay men, I've been reading some articles about gay men discriminating each other. Like, WTF?!  I understand some gay men have their preference, but seriously?! My advice to these men are, don’t show that ugly side of yourself.  You’ll never get far in life with an attitude like that.  Some people may not agree with me and act the way they want.  That’s fine.  However, it’s easy to weed those people out.  Just a thought, I guess.  Anyway, thinking about gay guys is getting me going.  
          I’m just checking out the boys that are at my school.  Am I being a pervert?! I probably am, but it’s something for me to do to kill time in the meantime.  I’m just “people watching.”  I just want to look like busy doing something.  Haha. I’m going to leave it here until next time. Peace.  </p>

      <h4>Finals</h4>
      <h5>12/04/2018</h5>
      <p>This semester is coming to an end.  I can't believe it's already December.  Christmas is just around the corner.  I'm definitely feeling the stress for finals.  I need to finish strong.  There is still another week of school, but I need to start preparing.  I'm going to need a bottle of Jameson and some friends to party with, after.  Lol. I'm ready for finals to be over already. I hope Fresno State is ready for me, becasue I'm ready for whatever comes my way. :P  </p>

      <h4>Hooker Boots</h4>
      <h5>12/02/2018</h5>
      <p>I thought I'd share this with you.  So you all know that I'm somewhat obsessed with women's shoes.  Espicially high heels.  Look at these hooker boots I found at a Museum in Visalia, California at the Historic Mooney Grove Park. </p>

    <h6>Bad Dream?!</h6>
    <h5>12/02/2018</h5>
    <p>Everyone in their life time had dreamt of something bad.  It could have been about losing someone, a "monster" chasing them, or even death.  Well, this morning, I had a dream that my boyfrined was cheating on me.  I became very violent with a knife in my hand.  I started to swing the knife towards him.  I couldn't believe it myself.  I was furious.  I wanted to kill him.  
      I have to say though, before we both slept, we got into a minor arugement.  Therefore, I went to bed in a weird head space.  Wheew, thank gawd it was only just a dream.   </p>

    <h4>Results after Orientation</h4>
    <h5>12/01/2018</h5>
    <p>So, I was pretty excited about the orientation. However, the first half was not worth my time.  The expectation of having students do the pre-orientation online, then reiterating it, was "dumb." I met this Hmong guy and it turns out he was going into the same field as I am.  We connected instantly, mainly because we share the same culture background.  Our major advisors were amazing.  Ugh, there were two hot advisor boys.  I couldn't stop staring. Lol.  Overall, I'm exhausted and I'm glad that was over. </p>

    <h4>Orientation at FSU</h4>
    <h5>12/01/2018</h5>
    <p>Today is the first day of orientation at Fresno State University.  I worked my butt off to get here.  It took me a long time, but I finally did it.  I can't wait to work on my Bachelor’s Degree and be set up for my career.  I'm so proud of myself. My advice for those who think they can't, you can.  It takes dedication and hard work.  Just believe in yourself and you will get what you want in life.  I remember telling myself, "I wish I could fast forward" (to this point), and I can't believe I'm here.  You have a purpose in life.  You can't wait for someone to do it for you.  You just need to be confident and "JUST DO IT!!!"</p>

          <h4>What hobby would you get into if time and money weren’t an issue?</h4>
          <h5>11/29/2018</h5>
          <p>Wow! If money wasn't an issue, I would like to lots of things.  I wouldn't call this a hobby, but I would like to make a career out of shoe desgining.  Everyone needs a pair of shoes in their life.  I've been following some great designer and they have opened my eyes about designing shoes on how you want them to be.  From top deginers in LA to Italy, the sky is the limit. This is just the artistic side of me.  </p>

          <h4>What fictional place would you most like to go?</h4>
          <h5>11/29/2018</h5>
          <p>That's an easy question.  Hogwarts.  I know Universal Studios built Hogwarts, BUT, I've never been just yet.  I really want to go and experience the life as a wizard or witch.  I think magic is amazing.  You can do all sorts of things.  I would love to cast spells, fight off bad people, and so on. There's magic in all of us.  </p>

          <p>Oh gosh. My favorite drink?  Well, I have a few favorite drinks.  My favorite non-alcoholic drink is something tropical.  I love drinking 100% fruit juice.  But, if we are talking about cocktail, my go to drink is, good old Grey Goose dirty martini. Extra dirty with extra olives. YUM. </p>

          <h4>How different was your life one year ago?</h4>
          <h5>11/29/2018</h5>
          <p>I definitely have grown a lot.  I have done some things that I'm not proud of.  From then, I think I've become a better and stronger person.  I believe people do learn from their mistakes and people should get second chances.  People can do horrible things in life and should learn not to make the same mistake. So, I've grown to be a better person.</p>
